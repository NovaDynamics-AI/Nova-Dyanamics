# Nova Dynamics Architecture

## Overview

Nova Dynamics is built on a modern, scalable architecture that combines multiple programming languages and paradigms to deliver a powerful AI engine. The core components are written in Rust for performance, with TypeScript for the frontend and Go for networking.

## Key Components

### Runtime Engine (Rust)
- High-performance core processing
- Memory management and optimization
- Plugin system implementation
- Token management and rate limiting

### Frontend Interface (TypeScript)
- React-based UI components
- Real-time updates and monitoring
- Interactive model configuration
- Performance analytics dashboard

### Networking Layer (Go)
- High-throughput request handling
- Load balancing and routing
- WebSocket support for real-time communication
- Service discovery and health checking

## Data Flow

1. Client Request → Go Network Layer
2. Request Routing → Rust Runtime Engine
3. Plugin Processing → Memory Storage
4. Response Generation → Client

## Security

- Rate limiting per user/token
- Request validation and sanitization
- Secure plugin isolation
- Encrypted communication channels
